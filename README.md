An application for listing movies by genre, developed during the first challenge of Ignite, Rocketseat's bootcamp, specifically, from the ReactJS Trail. The project was developed from a previously available template.

The main goal of the challenge was to refactor the `App` component, stripping all the logic and HTML inside it, splitting them into **three components**:

- `Sidebar`: In the sidebar it is possible to select which category of movies should be listed;
- `Header`: The application header has only the name of the selected category which must dynamically change.
- `Content`: The content contains the list of cards of the movies that are contained in the selected category.
